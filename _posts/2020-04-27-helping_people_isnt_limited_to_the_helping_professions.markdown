My journey into data science…

I want to make a difference in people's lives and to know that the work I'm doing has an impact in the world. Throughout the past few years, I have learned a lot about myself, much of which I wouldn't have expected to discover. My heart has always been to help people, which is why I got my masters in counseling. But over time, my understanding of what it means to make a difference has expanded far beyond the four walls I had contained it to once upon a time.

In counseling, you learn skills that focus on:

* Analyzing current issues
* Investigating the influence of the past on the present
* Exploring solutions for a brighter future

As a millennial, I've recognized more and more that the advancement of technology addresses and actually facilitates all three of those aspects. Imagining the potential that data science presents, I couldn’t be more excited to delve in.

Through my work experiences, there are a few things I have realized about myself: I am passionate, driven, and creative. I have an innate desire to seek growth, both personally and in the projects I devote myself to. I have a knack for gathering information, strategizing, and coming up with processes to improve efficiency. And if there is a problem or mystery at hand, I am determined to figure out how to solve it.

I want to be a part of something big, and I know that there is so much undiscovered potential in the realm of data that provides the opportunity to spread an impact to greater lengths than I could reach on my own. I want to know how to combine my heart and passion with my gifts and interests, and that is what has brought me to where I am now.

Currently, I am learning the ins and outs of data science in an intensive Data Science Bootcamp with Flatiron School. Intensive is definitely an accurate adjective to use, and I am loving every minute of it. We take a deep dive into data analysis through python and statistics. Every day, I have been pushed to learn, to implement, and to recognize the endless applications available.

I’m excited to discover the possibilities ahead in the world of data, and the difference I can make through it. Thank you for joining me on this journey.
